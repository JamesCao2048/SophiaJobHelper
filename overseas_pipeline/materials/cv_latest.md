Research Interests
• Primary: Human-AI Collaboration; Human-Centered AI
• Secondary: Responsible and Trustworthy AI; AI-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis
• Tertiary: Human Aspects of Software Engineering; Computational Social Science
A key challenge today is the ever-growing volume of large, complex, and unstructured data, such as
text, code, and images, produced by individuals, organizations, and society. Empowering humans
to understand and make meaningful use of such data remains a significant problem. To address
this, I leverage AI techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), with methodologies from
social science to design human–AI collaborative systems. To ensure these systems are usable and
adaptable in real-world settings, I apply empirical, human-centered methods including interviews
and user studies. These approaches help me understand the practices of professionals such as
software engineers, designers, and researchers, and identify key human-centered design principles.
My long-term goal is to enable individuals and teams to perform tasks beyond their original
capabilities by creating the next generation of human–AI systems.
