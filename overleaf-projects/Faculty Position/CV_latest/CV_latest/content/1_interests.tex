A key challenge today is the ever-growing volume of large, complex, and unstructured data, such as text, code, and images, produced by individuals, organizations, and society. Empowering humans to understand and make meaningful use of such data remains a significant problem. To address this, I leverage AI techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), with methodologies from social science to design human–AI collaborative systems. To ensure these systems are usable and adaptable in real-world settings, I apply empirical, human-centered methods including interviews and user studies. These approaches help me understand the practices of professionals such as software engineers, designers, and researchers, and identify key human-centered design principles. My long-term goal is to enable individuals and teams to perform tasks beyond their original capabilities by creating the next generation of human–AI systems.
